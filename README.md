## What is provably-fair?

Provably fair is a tool that allows the user to verify each roll result to prevent potential cheating. 
This is done using a cryptographic algorithm that combines a **client seed**, generated by the user and a **server seed**, generated by the host and runs the result through a hash algorithm to return a predetermined result. The result and seeds are public information so the player can verify the results themselves.
